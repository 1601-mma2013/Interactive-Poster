# I. Analysis
## 1. Research  
### a. Scope
1. Objectives

	To let the univeristy clubs and societies to have a better method to promote and publicize their events.

### b. Audit

Review existing work and product

####1. Field (market) research

The links below are the existing work and products that similar to the installation that we are goint to do.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGoZktCzMS4

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFgvNMN2DiQ

We are using these 2 links as a reference due to technique is similar with what we are going to do. What makes our installation different from them is that our target audience will be students in the university. We will help the event organisers from the club and societies in university to put up their information and animate them into an infographic animation that will attract the attention of the audiences. For the content of this interactive poster is base on what client need but we recommend client to use typographic, it can be renenber by user easily.

####2. Competitors / Alternatives / Replacement

####3. Relevant Technologies

The technologies that we are going to use, hardwares are kinect V1/V2, a personal computer, an ultra-short projector and also four wall hanging LED screen. For the software will be Adobe After Effects and Processing. 

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
Understand product vision and constraints

1. Product vision 
	- The content of this interactive poster is more in infograhic and advertising.
	- User may remember the information sharing by using interactive poster.
 
2. Risk
	- The audience might not really understand how interactive poster functioned.
	- Visual content may not able to every generation.

3. Obstacles
	- The risk of using kinect is it might not function properly when a lot of people detected in front of the kinect. The device and the processing might malfunction.
	- User may not spend their time more to interact with interactive poster.
	
 
4. Constraints 
	- User do not really think that this interactive poster can link to every club and society.
	- Users ignore the application if they think it is an extra for them.

## 2. Modeling


### a. Personas
Name : Wo Bu Dong
Occupation : Student, Event Organiser
Age : 18


1. **Goals** 
To really interact with the artwork itself and explore the meaning of the content behind

2. Patterns in user and customer behaviors - Bu Dong always too focus on one thing that will make her missed other things, and make her become very careless. 

3. Attitudes - She is good in design
             - She is very self discipline

4. Aptitudes - She uses poster as her method for publicity of her events

5. Environments - bulletin board

6. Tools - LED screens, Computer, Kinect

### b. Other Models
Represent domain factors beyond individual users and customers

1. Workflows among multiple people

2. Environments

3. Artifacts
# II. Synthesis
## 3. Requirements Definition
### a. Context Scenarios

A sample context scenario

The following is the first iteration of a context scenario for a primary persona for a personal digital assistant (PDA) type phone, including both the device and its service. Our persona is Vivien Strong, a real-estate agent in Indianapolis, whose goals are to balance work and home life, close the deal, and make each client feel like he or she is her only client.

Here is Vivien’s context scenario:

1. While getting ready in the morning, Vivien uses her phone to check her e-mail. Because it has a relatively large screen and quick connection time, it’s more convenient than booting up a computer as she rushes to make her daughter, Alice, a sandwich for school.
2. Vivien sees an e-mail from her newest client, Frank, who wants to look at a house this afternoon. The device has his contact info, so she can call him with a simple action right from the e-mail.
3. While on the phone with Frank, Vivien switches to speakerphone so she can view the screen while talking. She looks at her appointments to see when she’s free. When she creates a new appointment, the phone automatically makes it an appointment with Frank, because it knows with whom she is talking. She quickly enters the address of the property into the appointment as she finishes her conversation.
4. After sending Alice to school, Vivien heads into the real-estate office to gather some papers for another appointment. Her phone has already updated her Outlook appointments, so the rest of the office knows where she’ll be in the afternoon.
5. The day goes by quickly, and eventually Vivien is running a bit late. As she heads toward the property she’ll be showing Frank, the phone alerts her that her appointment is in 15 minutes. When she flips open the phone, she sees not only the appointment, but also a list of all documents related to Frank, including e-mails, memos, phone messages, and call logs to Frank’s number. Vivien initiates a call, and the phone automatically connects to Frank because it knows her appointment with him is soon. She lets him know she’ll be there in 20 minutes.
6. Vivien knows the address of the property but is unsure exactly where it is. She pulls over and taps the address she put into the appointment. The phone downloads directions along with a thumbnail map showing her location relative to the destination.
7. Vivien gets to the property on time and starts showing it to Frank. She hears the phone ring from her purse. Normally while she is in an appointment, the phone automatically goes to voicemail, but Alice has a code she can press to get through. The phone knows it’s Alice calling, so it uses a distinctive ringtone.
8. Vivien takes the call. Alice missed the bus and needs to be picked up. Vivien calls her husband to see if he can do it. She gets his voicemail; he must be out of service range. She tells him she’s with a client and asks if he can get Alice. Five minutes later the phone sounds a brief tone. Vivien recognizes it as her husband’s; she sees he’s sent her an instant message: “I’ll get Alice; good luck on the deal!”

Notice how the scenario remains at a fairly high level, without getting too specific about interfaces or technologies. It’s important to create scenarios that are within the realm of technical possibility, but at this stage the details of reality are unimportant. We want to leave the door open for truly novel solutions, and it’s always possible to scale back; we are ultimately trying to describe an optimal, yet still feasible, experience. Also notice how the activities in the scenario tie back to Vivien’s goals and try to eliminate as many tasks as possible.

//On Monday, Bu Dong went to her university. She went early morning to set up the booth the promote and publicize her club event, so she put flyers and poster on the table. Then she turn on a laptop to play the promotional video and put it on the table also. After that, she went to the bulletin board in front of the library and went back to her booth. Through out the whole publicizing session, she realise that there are only few people that will stop and really take a look on the poster, flyer or the promotional video. Others were just walked by and ignored them. In the end, during evening, she kept all the stuff and went back home, and only get a few number of participant to join her event. So during night time, she figure out that she need something more interesting something that can catch the attention of the students attention easily to promote her event effectively.

#### . Technology

The technology we using for this interactive poster is Kinect2.0. Besides that, we are using processing 3.0, JAVA Script coding for our base. The reason why we using kinect2.0 for interactive poster is it can detect 6 person at the same time and fully body structure including face emotion. Other than that, we convert the poster into PNG sequence and using "MAP" method to detect the movement of the user so the interactive poster will according the user movement to have different effect.


## 4. Design Framework
### a. Elements
Deﬁne manifestations of information and functionality

####1. Information
[![floor_plan.jpg](https://s20.postimg.org/dq3uszwml/floor_plan.jpg)](https://postimg.org/image/prz8n55ux/)
The different betweene interactive poster and graphic poster design without any interactive is attraction and neglection. Human need can remmeber and get the information easily while they are joining in or a part of this installation.

The size of interactive poster is quite big which is 10 feets X 8 feets, the capacity of people joining maximum is 6 person. We link 4 LED screen together and user can do any bidy movement in front of the screen, it can detect the body movement of user to show different infographic for the user.
