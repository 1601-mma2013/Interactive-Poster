# Project Name
# I. Analysis
## 1. Research  
### a. Scope
1. objectives

Do you ever notice that people nowadays won't really take time to focus on the detail of an artwork, for example a poster to advertise some products or events, people juss pass by but they only know there is a product on sales or an event on going but they will not stop and look into it. Another example, a wall painting, we as the audience normally enter the gallery just to look at the beauty of the painting but never trying to understand it.
So we are going to do an installation that can make the audience really stop while they're walking and interact with our artwork. Since our target audience mostly are university students, so our content will do something that related to university student life. The interaction method is the content we are going to express it through video, or image sequence, then the video will react based on the movement of the audience.
As the audience walk forward, the video will play, if the audience stop walking, the video pause, if the audience walk backward then the video will rewind. The speed of the video will depends on the walking speed of the audience, so if the audience want to look on the detail of the video he/she have to walk slowly then only able to watch clearly.

### b. Audit
Review existing work and product

1. Field (market) research
The links below are the existing work and products that similar to the installation that we are goint to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGoZktCzMS4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFgvNMN2DiQ
They name this kind of installation as interactive wall

2. competitors / alternatives / replacement
The competitors of this installation will be those artists that have the similar concept with us, though the content might be different.

4. relevant technologies 
The technologies that we are going to use, hardwares are kinect V1/V2, a personal computer, an ultra-short projector and also a white screen. For the software will be Adobe After Effects and Processing. 

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
Understand product vision and constraints
1. product{project} vision 

2. risk
	3. The audience might not really interact with our installation.
3. Obstacles
	1. The risk of using kinect is it might not function properly when a lot of people detected in front of the kinect. The device and the processing might malfunction.
 
4. constraints 
	1. Internal limitations 
		The limitations that we are currently facing is we never done this kind of project before, and without anybody teaching, we have to search for tutorials and learn ourselves. 
	1. **In spite of** the obstacles, we are very fortunate that our cost for the devices were supported by Centre of Interaction Media, and some of the seniors can provide us some suggestion and also tutorials. Lastly is in Media Art Design 3, we get the chance to exhibit our installation in a showcase.


5. users 

### d. User observations
Understand user needs and behavior and describe it.
Find various aspect of audience/customer
 
1. Users

2. potential users - The students all around the university

3. (user’s) behaviors - Keep on rushing, never notice things around them

4. (user’s) attitudes - neglectful

5. (user’s) aptitudes
	- By walking by our installation, the audience will slow down and start to interact our artwork which will make them relax, and have fun

6. (user’s) motivations - Try to not just only focus on a single goal or only solving problems using one perspective, try to slow down and think of another solution or notice on other little things around you, that will be the things that make you success.

7. (user’s) environments - Exhibitions

8. (user’s) tools - Whole body

9. (user’s) challenges - Doesn't really care about others.

## 2. Modeling
### a. Personas
Name : Goh Peh Min
Occupation : Student
Age : 18


1. **goals** 
To really interact with the artwork itself and explore the meaning of the content behind

2. Patterns in user and customer behaviors - Peh Min always too focus on one thing that will make her missed other things, and make her become very careless. 

3. attitudes - She wish that she can overcome the carelessness.

4. aptitudes - She can solves the problems by looking at the problems through different perspectives. 

5. environments - public space

6. tools - hand

### b. Other Models
Represent domain factors beyond individual users and customers
1. Workflows among multiple people

2. environments

3. artifacts
# II. Synthesis
