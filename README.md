### a. Scope
1. Objectives

To let the clubs and societies to have a better method to promote and publicize their events.

### b. Audit
Review existing work and product

1. Field (market) research
The links below are the existing work and products that similar to the installation that we are goint to do.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGoZktCzMS4

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFgvNMN2DiQ

We are using these 2 links as a reference due to technique is similar with what we are going to do. What makes our installation different from them is that our target audience will be students in the university. We will help the event organisers from the club and societies to put up their information and animate them into an infographic animation that will attract the attention of the audiences. 

2. Competitors / Alternatives / Replacement

The competitors of this installation will be those artists that have the similar concept with us, though the content might be different. 

Pros - Improved publicity of the events

Cons - Costed higher then normal publicity method

3. Relevant technologies 

The technologies that we are going to use, hardwares are kinect V1/V2, a personal computer, an ultra-short projector and also a white 

screen. For the software will be Adobe After Effects and Processing. 

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
Understand product vision and constraints
1. Product {project} vision 

2. Risk
	- The audience might not really interact with our installation.
3. Obstacles
	- The risk of using kinect is it might not function properly when a lot of people detected in front of the kinect. The device and the processing might malfunction.
 
4. Constraints 
	- The students do not really think that this installation is needed
	- The students totally ignore the installation

5. Users

### a. Context Scenarios
On Monday, Peh Min woke up early as usual to prepare herself to university. She has to do a presentation about the progress of her assignment that day, and she felt bored, because she feels like she go to university just for assignment and study and graduate with the certificate. Besides that she also felt very streesed because she need to submit the assignment next week, and the assignments are going to take most of her free time. After she arrived at university, she rush to the class as usual just in case not to get late for her presentation, but something stops her. A big screen that shows the video that react based on her movement stopped her, as she walk slowly, backward and forward again, she tested the installation. The video is about the fun moments in the university, such as having fun while doing assignments, go for sports, gaming for relax and more. As she watch the video carefully, she realise that she might change her boring university life. So she quickly rush to the class and do her presentation. After that, she invited her friends, go to a coffee shop, discuss while relaxing themselves, and they find that it is more effective to finish the assignment and more enjoyable. After the discussion, is already night time, so she went back to sleep. Before she sleep, she recall the installation she watched this morning and she think that, she might as well enjoy her uni life as the video shown on the installation. 

### b. Requirements
Describe necessary capabilities of the product
1. Functional and data needs

5. Business requirements

- Collected Information
# 



6. Technology

The technology we using for this interactive poster is Kinect2.0. Besides that, we are using processing 3.0, JAVA Script coding for our base. The reason why we using kinect2.0 for interactive poster is it can detect 6 person at the same time and fully body structure including face emotion. Other than that, we convert the poster into PNG sequence and using "MAP" method to detect the movement of the user so the interactive poster will according the user movement to have different effect.
