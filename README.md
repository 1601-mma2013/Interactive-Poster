	The technologies that we are going to use, hardwares are kinect V1/V2, a personal computer, an ultra-short projector and also four wall hanging LED screen. For the software will be Adobe After Effects and Processing. 

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
Understand product vision and constraints

1. Product {project} vision 

2. Risk
	- The audience might not really interact with our installation.

3. Obstacles
	- The risk of using kinect is it might not function properly when a lot of people detected in front of the kinect. The device and the processing might malfunction.

### a. Context Scenarios
On Monday, Bu Dong went to her university. She went early morning to set up the booth the promote and publicize her club event, so she put flyers and poster on the table. Then she turn on a laptop to play the promotional video and put it on the table also. After that, she went to the bulletin board in front of the library and went back to her booth. Through out the whole publicizing session, she realise that there are only few people that will stop and really take a look on the poster, flyer or the promotional video. Others were just walked by and ignored them. In the end, during evening, she kept all the stuff and went back home, and only get a few number of participant to join her event. So during night time, she figure out that she need something more interesting something that can catch the attention of the students attention easily to promote her event effectively.
