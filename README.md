	- The content of this interactive poster is more in infograhic and advertising
 

2. Risk
	- The audience might not really interact with our installation.

3. Obstacles
	- The risk of using kinect is it might not function properly when a lot of people detected in front of the kinect. The device and the processing might malfunction.
	- User may not spend their time to interact with interactive poster
	- User may 
 
4. Constraints 
	- The students do not really think that this installation is needed
	- The students totally ignore the installation

### a. Context Scenarios

A sample context scenario

The following is the first iteration of a context scenario for a primary persona for a personal digital assistant (PDA) type phone, including both the device and its service. Our persona is Vivien Strong, a real-estate agent in Indianapolis, whose goals are to balance work and home life, close the deal, and make each client feel like he or she is her only client. 

Here is Alyssa’s context scenario:

1. 8:00 O' clock early in the morning, Alyssa woke up and prepare to go for her class. While preparing, she saw a flyer on the floor, she quickly pick it up and throw it into the dustbin. Then she walk to the class by taking the same path as usual. While she walk through Central Plaza, a lot of students asked her to join the events, gave her flyers, but she declined all of them. She saw four LED screens were set on the wall of the library, but she didn't care about it so she just walk by because it was the same poster as she saw in the morning. But then something caught her attention, the content of the poster in the LED screen move as well as she moved. Then, she try to play around with it and she find it very interesting. By playing with the installation, she also saw a lot of informations of the event and photos from the event before. She began to get interested about the event, but it is time for her class so she rush to her class immediately. After her class, she want to walk back to her hostel. On the same way, she realise that there are a lot of people gathering in front of the library which they are playing with the installation itself. Then she decided to walk to the booth and ask for the detail. Finally she joined the event as a participant. Then she walk back to her hostel and rest.

Other than that, we convert the poster into PNG sequence and using "MAP" method to detect the movement of the user so the interactive poster will according the user movement to have different effect.
