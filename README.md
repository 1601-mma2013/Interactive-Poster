# I. Analysis
## 1. Research  
### a. Scope
1. objectives

Students nowadays only focus on their own things and due to their busyness, they became neglectful. Since they had used to being neglectful, most of them will only step in their own shoes. So the consequence is, when they face problem they will only see it through their own perspective. That's the reason for our project "UniLife". UniLife let the students realise that :
 - Giving attentions to others may learn something new
 - Good things only for those who are patience
 - Spending time to earn experience
 - There are a lot of things can be done in university

UniLife : It is an interactive installation that we want the aundience which is students to really slow down and play with it, discover it and exlpore it themselves. The interaction method that we used is the video will react based on the audience movement. If the audience walk forward, the video will play, if the audience stop walking, the video will pause, if the audience walk backward, the video will rewind. To really look into the content of the video, they need to adjust their walking speed since the video will react based on their movements.

### b. Audit
Review existing work and product

1. Field (market) research
The links below are the existing work and products that similar to the installation that we are goint to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGoZktCzMS4
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFgvNMN2DiQ
They name this kind of installation as interactive wall.
We are using these 2 links as a reference due to technique is similar with what we are going to do. What makes our installation different from them is that our target audience will be students in the university. As our content will show the daily life and things that students will and can do. We divided the content into 4 parts, study, sports, relationships and gaming. Which will presents that university life can be very colourful, not as lifeless as they think. By letting them realise the fun of university life, it might change their attitude of being neglectful. 

2. competitors / alternatives / replacement
The competitors of this installation will be those artists that have the similar concept with us, though the content might be different.

4. relevant technologies 
The technologies that we are going to use, hardwares are kinect V1/V2, a personal computer, an ultra-short projector and also a white screen. For the software will be Adobe After Effects and Processing. 

### c. Stakeholder Interviews (internal / external)
Understand product vision and constraints
1. product{project} vision 

2. risk
	3. The audience might not really interact with our installation.
3. Obstacles
	1. The risk of using kinect is it might not function properly when a lot of people detected in front of the kinect. The device and the processing might malfunction.
 
4. constraints 
	1. Internal limitations 
		The limitations that we are currently facing is we never done this kind of project before, and without anybody teaching, we have to search for tutorials and learn ourselves. 
	1. **In spite of** the obstacles, we are very fortunate that our cost for the devices were supported by Centre of Interaction Media, and some of the seniors can provide us some suggestion and also tutorials. Lastly is in Media Art Design 3, we get the chance to exhibit our installation in a showcase.


5. users 

### d. User observations
Understand user needs and behavior and describe it.
Find various aspect of audience/customer
 
1. Users

2. potential users - The students all around the university

3. (user’s) behaviors - Keep on rushing, never notice things around them

4. (user’s) attitudes - neglectful

5. (user’s) aptitudes
	- Because of busyness, they neglect most of the things that happen around them.

6. (user’s) motivations - Try to not just only focus on a single goal or only solving problems using one perspective, try to slow down and think of another solution or notice on other little things around you, that will be the things that make you success.

7. (user’s) environments - Corridors around the campus, Exhibitions

8. (user’s) tools - Whole body

9. (user’s) challenges - Doesn't really care about others.

## 2. Modeling
### a. Personas
Name : Goh Peh Min
Occupation : Student
Age : 18


1. **goals** 
To really interact with the artwork itself and explore the meaning of the content behind

2. Patterns in user and customer behaviors - Peh Min always too focus on one thing that will make her missed other things, and make her become very careless. 

3. attitudes - She wish that she can overcome the carelessness.

4. aptitudes - She can solves the problems by looking at the problems through different perspectives. 

5. environments - public space

6. tools - hand
